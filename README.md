# Reach: A Localized Social Media Application

Welcome to **Reach**, a social media application built to foster localized social interactions using GPS. This project is developed as a graduation final thesis for the **Faculdade de Engenharia Mecânica (FEM)** of the **Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP)**, Brazil.

## Overview

**Reach** is more than just another social media application. It harnesses the power of your device's GPS to help users connect and engage with their local communities. Whether it's a café down the street, an event happening in your neighborhood, or just daily chatter from around your locality, **Reach** keeps you connected and informed.

## Development

This application is the brainchild of **Francisco Ignácio Fontoura Solla**, a student from the **Engenharia de Controle e Automação** course at UNICAMP. Under the guidance of Dr. Niederauer Mastelari, the application aims to change how we perceive localized social interactions in the digital age.
