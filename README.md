# Reach: A Localized Social Media Application

Welcome to **Reach**, a social media application built to foster localized social interactions using GPS. This project is developed as a graduation final thesis for the **Faculdade de Engenharia Mecânica (FEM)** of the **Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP)**, Brazil.

## Overview

**Reach** is more than just another social media application. It harnesses the power of your device's GPS to help users connect and engage with their local communities. Whether it's a café down the street, an event happening in your neighborhood, or just daily chatter from around your locality, **Reach** keeps you connected and informed.

## Development

This application is the brainchild of **Francisco Ignácio Fontoura Solla**, a diligent student from the **Engenharia de Controle e Automação** course at UNICAMP. Under the expert guidance of Dr. Niederauer Mastelari, the application aims to change how we perceive localized social interactions in the digital age.

## Technical Overview

- **Framework**: The project is developed using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with the [Expo](https://expo.dev/) platform, making it seamless and efficient to develop and test across different mobile devices.

- **Backend**: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is used as the primary server service, ensuring real-time data flow, user authentication, and data storage.

- **Icons**: For a rich user interface, the project incorporates icons from [`@expo/vector-icons`](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/icons/). You can explore and search for the available icons at [icons.expo.fyi](https://icons.expo.fyi/).

## Getting Started

If you wish to set up and run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/reach.git
   cd reach```

2. Install the dependencies:
  ```yarn install```

3. Start the Expo development server:
  ```expo start```

Once the Expo development server is running, you can open the application on your device using the Expo Go app or on an emulator.
